Hi, I'm Edward! Somewhere in the course of majoring in philosophy, teaching in
Japan, and working for Democratic campaigns, I discovered R. Today I work as a
data scientist for [Uptake](https://www.uptake.com/) in Chicago and spend a lot
of time exploring R and data science for work and fun.

On this website, you can expect 

* data visualizations, both
  * static and
  * animated and interactive plots;
* exciting functions to make life easier;
* updates and information about packages I write (see the menu above for their 
  READMEs with links to their sites);
* wonderfulness from packages I love; and 
* other odds and ends which may or may not relate to R, data science, politics, 
  foreign affairs, philosophy or another subject that piques my interest and 
  which I find worth writing about.

If you have a question, want to grab a coffee in Chicago, or otherwise would 
like to chat, please reach out via Twitter, email, or whatever other means you 
prefer.

I hope something here excites you as much as it does me. Enjoy!

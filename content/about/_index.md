Hi, I'm Edward! Somewhere in the course of majoring in philosophy, teaching in Japan, and working for Democratic campaigns, I discovered and became enamored of R. Today I live in Washington DC and still teach, but on the side spend a lot of time exploring the vast worlds of R and data science.

On this website, you can expect 

* data visualizations, both
  * static (ggplot) and
  * animated and interactive plots;
* exciting functions to make life easier;
* updates and information about packages I write (see the menu above for their READMEs with links to their sites);
* wonderfulness from packages I love; and 
* other odds and ends which may or may not relate to R, data science, politics, foreign affairs, philosophy or any other subject that piques my interest and surpasses my standards for asking your attention.

If you have a question, would like to hire me, want to grab a coffee in DC, or otherwise would like to chat, please reach out via Twitter, email, or whatever other means you prefer.

I hope something here excites you as much as it does me. Enjoy!

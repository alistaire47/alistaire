## Motivation 

Lately I've been working on a project using a significant amount of
[sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/). The analysis itself thus far is not
particularly noteworthy—I've posted some of the more interesting plots on 
[my Twitter](https://twitter.com/alistaire)—but some of the munging code is
interesting, so here's a post.

In the course of seeking out data, I found what I was looking for through an 
API that takes latitude and longitude paramters and a `radius` parameter (in 
meters, with a maximum). The question, then, was how to get data without making 
a silly amount of calls or duplicating results more than necessary.

## County centroids

### Getting data

One option is to pick a geographic unit that will largely fit within the radius 
and calculate centroids to serve as latitude and logitude. Using counties as a 
unit and the [tigris](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) package to get 
shapefiles from the Census, 

```{r counties, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# tell tigris to return sf objects instead of sp
options(tigris_class = "sf")

# set `cb = TRUE` to get low-resolution shapes
counties <- tigris::counties(cb = TRUE)

counties
```

The resulting sf object has various columns that can be used to join it with 
non-spatial data, including state and county 
[FIPS codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards), 
and other possibly-useful information like land and water area. Most 
importantly, though, it has a `geometry` column, with each element  containing 
a multipolygon simple feature of a county. The front matter contains contextual 
information like the bounding box and map projection.

### ggplot2 and sf

As [ggplot has nice sf support](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html), 
visualizing is easy, if slow. To make a choropleth of each county's land area 
in California (FIPS `06`), say,

```{r plot-ca, message=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
theme_set(hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_ps(grid = FALSE))

ca_plot <- counties %>% 
    filter(STATEFP == "06") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(fill = ALAND / 10e8)) + 
    geom_sf(color = NA) + 
    scale_fill_viridis_c(quote("Billion "*m^2)) + 
    labs(title = "California", subtitle = "County land area", 
         caption = "Source: Census 2016") + 
    theme(panel.grid = element_line(NA), 
          axis.text = element_text(colour = NA))

ca_plot
```

Hm, it looks like one of these counties is *really big*, so a centroid approach 
might not be practical. Let's add county names to the plot to see which county 
it is.

### Calculating centroids

...ah, crap. While `stat_sf` can plot a number of geoms, its capabilities don't 
currently include `geom_text`, so we'll need to calculate some coordinates at 
which to place the labels. Happily, the centroid is a good place to stick 
labels anyway, so we can get an idea of what the set of centroids would look 
like at the same time. Calculating the centroid of a multipolygon in sf is as 
easy as calling `st_centroid`:

```{r centroids}
county_centroids <- counties %>% st_centroid()
```
It prints a message that the centroids are not totally accurate for 
longitude/latitude data, but the results will be good enough for labels. The 
result is an sf object that contains points instead of multipolygons:
```{r print-centroids}
county_centroids %>% select(STATEFP, NAME)
```

Let's add them to the plot:
```{r ca-points, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
ca_plot + 
    geom_sf(data = filter(county_centroids, STATEFP == "06"), 
            color = "white")
```

### Extracting coordinates

When passed an sf object containing points, `geom_sf` plots points. The 
locations look good, but to use `geom_text`, we'll need to extract the 
coordinates to columns, which we can do with `st_coordinates`. It returns a 
matrix, so lets cbind it back to `county_centroids`:
```{r centroid-coords}
county_centroids <- county_centroids %>% 
    st_coordinates() %>% 
    as_data_frame() %>% 
    bind_cols(county_centroids, .)    # to keep class, sf object must be first

county_centroids %>% select(STATEFP, NAME, X, Y)
```
### Plotting labels

Much better. Now let's add labels to the plot:
```{r ca-labelled, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
ca_plot + 
    geom_text(aes(X, Y, label = NAME), 
              data = filter(county_centroids, STATEFP == "06"), 
              color = "white", size = 1) + 
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
```

A couple labels get partially lost in the background, but the plot is 
sufficient to see that San Bernardino county is the huge one. As it abuts Los 
Angeles county, its population probably isn't evenly distributed, either—most 
people likely live in the southwest.

### Getting Census data

Let's find out. We can use the 
[tidycensus](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus) package to pull variables 
from the Census and attach them to sf objects automatically downloaded with 
tigris. The first time you use it, you'll need to get and store an API key, the 
process for which is well-documented and not difficult.

Finding Census variable names *is* a little difficult, but a little searching 
with `tidycensus::load_variables` reveals that `B01003_001E` is 
`TOTAL POPULATION`. Let's grab it for San Bernardino County's census tracts:

```{r sb, cache=TRUE}
san_bernardino <- tidycensus::get_acs(
    geography = "tract",
    geometry = TRUE,    # return sf object, not ordinary tibble
    variables = "B01003_001E", 
    state = "06",    # "CA" would also work
    county = "071", 
    key = keyring::key_get('census')
)

san_bernardino
```

The variable is stored in the `estimate` column. Let's take a look:
```{r plot-sb}
ggplot(san_bernardino, aes(fill = estimate)) + 
    geom_sf(color = NA) + 
    scale_fill_viridis_c("Population", labels = scales::comma) + 
    labs(title = "San Bernardino", subtitle = "Population by Census tract", 
         caption = "Source: 2012–2016 ACS") + 
    theme(panel.grid = element_line(NA), 
          axis.text = element_text(colour = NA))
```

As census tracts are supposed to have fairly uniform populations, the map is 
slightly counterintuitive. Color does more to show what areas are growing and 
shrinking since tracts were last redrawn. Population density, then, is shown by 
the density of tracts themselves. Since everything but the southwest is in only 
a handful of tracts, the centroid is clearly a bad center around which to 
search.

## Point grids

So how shall we search? An alternative is to use a grid of evenly-spaced 
points. As we can control the size of the grid, we can ensure that it covers 
all of the desired area.

### `expand.grid` doesn't cut it

Normally to create a grid of values in R, we can use `expand.grid` or the like:
```{r expand.grid}
expand.grid(x = 1:3, y = 4:5)
```

Unfortunately, such an approach fails when applied to spatial data, though, as 
the distance between degrees of latitude and logitude depends a lot on where 
you are. If you were at the North Pole, took a step, turned left, and walked in 
a circle, you could cross every logitude in a few steps. At the Equator, such a 
feat would require quite a lot more steps.

Visually, on a projection stretched into a rectangle the results looks fine...

```{r}
theme_set(hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_ps())

grid_plot <- expand.grid(lon = seq(-180, 180, 10), 
                         lat = seq(-90, 90, 10)) %>% 
    pmap(~st_point(c(...))) %>%    # convert each pair to an sf point
    st_sfc(crs = 4326) %>%    # convert all points to sf column
    st_sf() %>%    # convert to sf data frame
    ggplot() + 
    geom_sf()

grid_plot
```

...but the view from the South Pole shows the whole bottom row of points are 
actually in the same place:

```{r}
grid_plot + coord_sf(crs = "+proj=laea +lat_0=-90 +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs")
```


### Spatial grids

Thus, even on a spherical Earth, to make an equally-spaced grid would take more 
math. Add in that the Earth is more ellipsoidal than spherical, and it is quite 
a hard problem. Happily, someone else has already done the math.

#### `geosphere::regularCoordinates`

The [geosphere](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geosphere/index.html) 
package offers one possibility with its `regularCoordinates` function. Passed 
an integer `N`, it divides the Earth N times in each direction, e.g.

```{r}
geosphere::regularCoordinates(1)

geosphere::regularCoordinates(1) %>% 
    as_data_frame() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) + 
    geom_point()
```
At scale, this is cool, showing the projection at work:
```{r}
geosphere::regularCoordinates(45) %>% 
    as_data_frame() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) + 
    geom_point(stroke = 0, alpha = 0.3)
```

By reading the results into sf, we can shift the projection and plot on an 
ellipsoid:
```{r}
geosphere_plot <- geosphere::regularCoordinates(10) %>% 
    as_data_frame() %>% 
    pmap(~st_point(c(...))) %>%    # convert each pair to an sf point
    st_sfc(crs = 4326) %>%    # convert all points to sf column
    st_sf() %>%    # convert to sf data frame
    ggplot() + 
    geom_sf()

geosphere_plot + coord_sf(crs = "+proj=laea +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs")
```
The edges are distorted, but that's ok—it's mostly a product of the projection. 
What matters is that the center looks reasonably grid-like, and indeed it does. 
Setting the center at the South Pole instead shows that everything is not 
*quite* square—the pieces at the pole are necessarily triangles, and those 
around it are occasionally triangles and often significantly distorted. 

```{r}
geosphere_plot + coord_sf(crs = "+proj=laea +lat_0=-90 +ellps=WGS84 +no_defs")
```

Everything is still reasonably evenly spaced, though, so this is still pretty 
usable, and a huge improvement over `expand.grid`.

#### `st_make_grid`

There are, though drawbacks to `regularCoordinates`. In particular, it can 
*only* take a number of subdivisions, which is awfully inconvenient when trying 
to set a reasonably consistent distance between points. Further, it *always* 
returns a grid for the entire globe, even if we only need a grid over a 
particular area.

A solution to these problems is provided by `st_make_grid`, which has a 
`cellsize` parameter and operates over the bounding box of an sf object. It can 
also return polygons, corners, or centers, as desired.

To make a grid over the continental US, first let's grab a shapefile of the 
states and subset out the outlying states and territories^[Dear inhabitants of 
said outlying states and territories: We still love you! Your land is just hard 
to fit in the same plot with the continental states and district without lots 
of blank space or separately scaled insets.]:

```{r}
states <- tigris::states(cb = TRUE) 

continental_us <- states %>% 
    filter(STUSPS %in% c('DC', state.abb[!state.abb %in% c('AK', 'HI')]))

continental_us %>% select(STUSPS, NAME)

ggplot(continental_us) + geom_sf()
```

Now we can use this sf object to supply a bounding box for `st_make_grid`. 
Supposing the API sweeps 100,000m circles, we'll need a distance between points 
of $100000*\sqrt{2}$ to ensure the full area is covered:

![point grid triangle diagram](point-grid.png)

Beforehand, we need to convert to a coordinate reference system that uses 
meters so we can specify the distance between points in meters. All together,

```{r}
continental_points <- continental_us %>% 
    st_transform(crs = 3857) %>%    # web mercator; has +units=m
    st_make_grid(cellsize = 100000*sqrt(2), what = 'centers') %>% 
    st_transform(crs = 4269)    # convert back

continental_points

continental_points %>% st_sf() %>% ggplot() + geom_sf()
```

Beautiful! We now have a grid of points covering the bounding box of the sf 
object—not, happily, the entire globe.

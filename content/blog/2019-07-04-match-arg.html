<p>Lately I’ve been working with a lot of people whose first language is not R,
which has given me more of an appreciation for R’s oddities. Some in retrospect
were probably ill-advised, like partial matching with <code>$</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mtcars$disp

#&gt; NULL</code></pre>
<p>Some are comparatively weird, but function fine, like that R doesn’t care if
keyword arguments come before positional ones; it just extracts keywords first
and then matches positions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(x = c(1, NA, 3), 0, TRUE)
#&gt; [1] 2
mean(na.rm = TRUE, c(1, NA, 3))
#&gt; [1] 2</code></pre>
<p>But some are weird, but actually really convenient and great, which brings us
to the subject of this post: <code>match.arg</code>.</p>
<p><code>match.arg</code> is a function that only works in functions, and thus is not itself
a function people tend to encounter until they try to write code for other
people. (You <em>could</em> use it in functions you write for yourself, but it matters
less, for reasons that will become apparent in a moment.) It’s also a function
that’s baked into much of R’s DNA, so to speak.</p>
<p>For instance, if you look at the documentation for <code>?optim</code>, base R’s
general-purpose optimization function, its “Usage” section looks like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>optim(par, fn, gr = NULL, ...,
      method = c(&quot;Nelder-Mead&quot;, &quot;BFGS&quot;, &quot;CG&quot;, &quot;L-BFGS-B&quot;, &quot;SANN&quot;,
                 &quot;Brent&quot;),
      lower = -Inf, upper = Inf,
      control = list(), hessian = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>Something there is a little funny: Why is the default of <code>method</code> a vector of
six methods? Is it going to run six different ways? The argument documentation
seems to suggest otherwise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>method</code> The method to be used. See ‘Details’. Can be abbreviated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Details” confirms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default method is an implementation of that of Nelder and Mead (1965),
that uses only function values and is robust but relatively slow. It will
work reasonably well for non-differentiable functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It then describes <code>"BFGS"</code>, <code>"CG"</code>, etc. as alternative methods, which makes
sense—the documentation is telling us all the possible alternatives. But
there’s still something weird here: Is the default really a vector of length 6?
Or is that just a documentation nicety, and the signature of the function
<em>actually</em> contains <code>method = "Nelder-Mead"</code>?</p>
<p>A quick investigation reveals that it’s not just a nicety—the actual default is
a vector of length 6</p>
<pre class="r"><code>args(optim)
#&gt; function (par, fn, gr = NULL, ..., method = c(&quot;Nelder-Mead&quot;, 
#&gt;     &quot;BFGS&quot;, &quot;CG&quot;, &quot;L-BFGS-B&quot;, &quot;SANN&quot;, &quot;Brent&quot;), lower = -Inf, 
#&gt;     upper = Inf, control = list(), hessian = FALSE) 
#&gt; NULL</code></pre>
<p>…but somehow that turns into a default of <code>"Nelder-Mead"</code>. How? The culprit
is a few lines into the body of the function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(optim, 8)
#&gt;                                                                 
#&gt; 1 function (par, fn, gr = NULL, ..., method = c(&quot;Nelder-Mead&quot;,  
#&gt; 2     &quot;BFGS&quot;, &quot;CG&quot;, &quot;L-BFGS-B&quot;, &quot;SANN&quot;, &quot;Brent&quot;), lower = -Inf, 
#&gt; 3     upper = Inf, control = list(), hessian = FALSE)           
#&gt; 4 {                                                             
#&gt; 5     fn1 &lt;- function(par) fn(par, ...)                         
#&gt; 6     gr1 &lt;- if (!is.null(gr))                                  
#&gt; 7         function(par) gr(par, ...)                            
#&gt; 8     method &lt;- match.arg(method)</code></pre>
<p>What does</p>
<pre class="r"><code>method &lt;- match.arg(method)</code></pre>
<p>do?</p>
<p>Starting at <code>?match.arg</code>, it tells us it does “argument verification using
partial matching”. More particularly,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>match.arg</code> matches <code>arg</code> against a table of candidate values as specified by
<code>choices</code>, where <code>NULL</code> means to take the first one.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “Usage” section confirms that <code>optim</code> <em>definitely</em> isn’t running six
methods by default:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>match.arg(arg, choices, several.ok = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>Ok, this seems to make some sense—<code>match.arg</code> checks whether an argument to a
function is within a list of possibilities. Let’s try it out:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>check_is_us_flag_color &lt;- function(color){
    match.arg(color, c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;))
}

check_is_us_flag_color(&quot;blue&quot;)
#&gt; [1] &quot;blue&quot;
tryCatch(
    check_is_us_flag_color(&quot;orange&quot;),
    error = identity
)
#&gt; &lt;simpleError in match.arg(color, c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;)): &#39;arg&#39; should be one of &quot;red&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Ooh, look, we even get informative error messages! How nice.</p>
<p>It’s supposed to do partial matching too. Let’s try:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>check_is_fourth_of_july_activity &lt;- function(activity){
    match.arg(activity, choices = c(
        &quot;watch a parade&quot;,
        &quot;barbeque in the park&quot;,
        &quot;watch fireworks&quot;
    ))
}

check_is_fourth_of_july_activity(&quot;watch fireworks&quot;)    # Still works.
#&gt; [1] &quot;watch fireworks&quot;
check_is_fourth_of_july_activity(&quot;barbeque&quot;)    # Works too!
#&gt; [1] &quot;barbeque in the park&quot;
tryCatch(
    check_is_fourth_of_july_activity(&quot;watch&quot;),    # Doesn&#39;t work. That&#39;s good.
    error = identity
)
#&gt; &lt;simpleError in match.arg(activity, choices = c(&quot;watch a parade&quot;, &quot;barbeque in the park&quot;,     &quot;watch fireworks&quot;)): &#39;arg&#39; should be one of &quot;watch a parade&quot;, &quot;barbeque in the park&quot;, &quot;watch fireworks&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This could be useful! It encourages us to use descriptive options like
<code>"Nelder-Mead"</code>, but if people don’t want to type that all the time, they can
just type the unambiguous <code>"Nelder"</code>, and that will work fine. Also, such a
sophisticated approach still takes very little effort from the person writing
the function, which is awfully nice.</p>
<details>
<p><summary>
If you want to understand the details of precisely <em>how</em> <code>match.arg</code> handles
partial matches</summary>, the documentation says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matching is done using <code>pmatch</code>, so <code>arg</code> may be abbreviated.</p>
</blockquote>
Clicking through and trying out <code>pmatch</code> shows it’s pretty simple—it’s not
fuzzy matching <em>à la</em> <code>agrep</code>, just matching from the beginning of strings.
</details>
<p>Ok, now we’ve got a grasp of how <code>match.arg</code> works, but that still doesn’t
explain how that line from <code>optim</code> works:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>method &lt;- match.arg(method)</code></pre>
<p>There are no choices specified! <code>?match.arg</code> gives us a hint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the one-argument form <code>match.arg(arg)</code>, the choices are obtained from a
default setting for the formal argument <code>arg</code> of the function from which
<code>match.arg</code> was called. (Since default argument matching will set <code>arg</code> to
<code>choices</code>, this is allowed as an exception to the ‘length one unless
<code>several.ok</code> is <code>TRUE</code>’ rule, and returns the first element.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot going on here. This directly answers one question: What happens
if <code>method</code> is not set? In this case, it will return the first element, which
is why the default is in fact <code>"Nelder-Mead"</code>.</p>
<p><em>Even if you never use <code>match.arg</code>, this behavior is a good thing to
understand,</em> because you’ll see documentation like this everywhere:
<code>?read.table</code>, <code>?png</code>, <code>?order</code>, <code>?t.test</code>, <code>?ggplot2::position_dodge</code>,
<code>?tidyr::fill</code>, <code>?data.table::shift</code>, etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>But there are two possibilities here:</p>
<ul>
<li>no argument is passed, and <code>match.arg</code> gets the full length-6 vector, or</li>
<li>an argument is passed, and <code>match.arg</code> is only passed one string.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking the first element of a vector explains how the first possibility works:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>check_good_firework &lt;- function(firework = c(&#39;bottle rocket&#39;, &#39;roman candle&#39;, &#39;ones that require a license&#39;)){
    match.arg(firework)
}

check_good_firework()
#&gt; [1] &quot;bottle rocket&quot;</code></pre>
<p><code>match.arg</code> is passed the full vector for <code>firework</code>, and picks the first one.
But is it using that vector for choices? Let’s see:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>check_good_firework(c(&#39;bottle rocket&#39;, &#39;roman candle&#39;, &#39;ones that require a license&#39;))
#&gt; [1] &quot;bottle rocket&quot;
tryCatch(
    check_good_firework(c(&#39;snake&#39;, &#39;M80&#39;)), 
    error = identity
)
#&gt; &lt;simpleError in match.arg(firework): &#39;arg&#39; must be of length 1&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Hmm, so it <em>is</em> getting the choices from somewhere. That’s good, as it explains
how the case in which an argument is passed is handled. But where is
<code>match.arg</code> getting the options if they aren’t passed to it? The docs, one more
time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the one-argument form <code>match.arg(arg)</code>, the choices are obtained from a
default setting for the formal argument <code>arg</code> of the function from which
<code>match.arg</code> was called.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, “the formal argument <code>arg</code> of the function from which <code>match.arg</code> was
called”. But what’s a “formal argument”? The details get a little
hairy<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, but essentially formals are the stuff you put in the parentheses
after <code>function</code>. There’s even a sensibly-named function to get them, should
you need:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(formals(optim))
#&gt; Dotted pair list of 9
#&gt;  $ par    : symbol 
#&gt;  $ fn     : symbol 
#&gt;  $ gr     : NULL
#&gt;  $ ...    : symbol 
#&gt;  $ method : language c(&quot;Nelder-Mead&quot;, &quot;BFGS&quot;, &quot;CG&quot;, &quot;L-BFGS-B&quot;, &quot;SANN&quot;, &quot;Brent&quot;)
#&gt;  $ lower  : language -Inf
#&gt;  $ upper  : num Inf
#&gt;  $ control: language list()
#&gt;  $ hessian: logi FALSE</code></pre>
<p>Notice this is not quite a normal list—some elements are empty (like <code>par</code> and
<code>fn</code>), and <code>...</code> is actually the name of an element (that doesn’t exist). It is
a list, but this is the topsy-turvy world of operating on the language, so this
is a <em>pairlist</em>, which only much ever gets used for messing with the structure
of functions.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Regardless, we can see that <code>method</code> is there with its default. The source of
<code>match.arg</code> shows how it gets the default to use for <code>choices</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(match.arg, 7)
#&gt;                                                                         
#&gt; 1 function (arg, choices, several.ok = FALSE)                           
#&gt; 2 {                                                                     
#&gt; 3     if (missing(choices)) {                                           
#&gt; 4         formal.args &lt;- formals(sys.function(sysP &lt;- sys.parent()))    
#&gt; 5         choices &lt;- eval(formal.args[[as.character(substitute(arg))]], 
#&gt; 6             envir = sys.frame(sysP))                                  
#&gt; 7     }</code></pre>
<p>This code is both complicated and hairy (please don’t use <code>&lt;-</code> in function
calls), but we can see that <code>sys.function</code> gets the calling function, and
<code>formals</code> extracts the formal arguments. Lines 5-6 extract the argument from
those formals.</p>
<p>Ignoring the environment-handling stuff, let’s try it out:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>show_function &lt;- function(x, y = c(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)){
    sys.function()
}

show_function()
#&gt; function(x, y = c(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)){
#&gt;     sys.function()
#&gt; }

fmls &lt;- formals(show_function())
str(fmls)
#&gt; Dotted pair list of 2
#&gt;  $ x: symbol 
#&gt;  $ y: language c(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)

fmls$y    # This is still a language object...
#&gt; c(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)
eval(fmls$y)    # ...so evaluate it to make it a real object
#&gt; [1] &quot;foo&quot; &quot;bar&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Cool! This code explains the remaining mystery of <code>match.arg</code>: When only passed
an argument, it grabs the default argument for that parameter and uses it as
<code>choices</code>. That also explains why <code>match.arg</code> only works in a function if
<code>choices</code> is not specified:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tryCatch(
    match.arg(c(&quot;bratwurst&quot;, &quot;hot dog&quot;, &quot;hamburger&quot;)),
    error = identity
)
#&gt; &lt;simpleError in formal.args[[as.character(substitute(arg))]]: no such index at level 1
#&gt; &gt;</code></pre>
<p>So when should you use <code>match.arg</code>? When you’re writing a function with a
parameter that can take one of a fairly small number of string values. In
return,</p>
<ul>
<li>your function will error informatively if passed an incorrect value (instead
of breaking wherever it gets used),</li>
<li>users get convenient partial-matching,<br />
</li>
<li>if you put the choices as the default, the possible choices will be very
clear (to people who know about <code>match.arg</code>), and</li>
<li>your friends coming from Python will reinforce their belief that R is
strange, but will be unable to reproduce the behavior in Python without
significant code.</li>
</ul>
<p>So is R quirky? Yep. But that’s not all bad.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn1"><p>This <code>NULL</code> bit is
confusing, even if you come back after reading everything. It refers to a call
like <code>match.arg(NULL, c("deviled eggs", "potato salad"))</code>, but the function
rarely gets used that way. The “take the first one” bit matters, though,
because this is the behavior if <code>choices</code> isn’t passed, as is explained later.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
